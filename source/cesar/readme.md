# Caesar Cipher

Caesar Cipher is one of the most known encryption algorithm. See more at [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To compile you need to have **gcc** on your machine.  

### Installing

To compile the cesar algorithm and its breaker you need type in terminal _(on cesar folder)_:

```
**$make main**
```

If you already have the files compiled and need to remove it:  

```
$make clean
```
Run the application:

```
$./cesar
```

## Running the tests

* You can always look at the contents of message and encrypted message on terminal.  
* Change the message that you want to encrypt in **/test/test1.txt**.  
* You can have a look at the encrypted message in **/test/out1.txt**.  
* The **key** for vigenere is inserted manually via terminal.
